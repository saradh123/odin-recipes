     <h2>

     </h2>
     <p>

     </p>
     <h2>
        Mix the Casserole
     </h2>
     <p>
        Mix the mashed (and cooled) sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, salt, butter, milk, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl until well-combined. Pour the mixture into a baking dish.

     <h2>

     <h2>

        Bake in a preheated oven until the topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
